# OpenCode MCP Tool

> **Documentation available in `docs/`** – Examples, FAQ, troubleshooting, best practices

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants to interact with the [OpenCode CLI](https://github.com/fictiverse/opencode). It enables AI assistants to leverage multiple AI models through a unified interface, with features like plan mode for structured thinking and extensive model selection.

- Ask questions through multiple AI models via Claude or other MCP clients
- Use plan mode for structured analysis and safer operations

## TLDR

Use OpenCode's multi-model capabilities directly in Claude Code with flexible model selection and plan mode features.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16.0.0 or higher)
2. **[OpenCode CLI](https://github.com/fictiverse/opencode)** installed and configured

### One-Line Setup (Claude Code)

```bash
claude mcp add opencode -- npx -y @gilby125/opencode-mcp-tool -- --model google/gemini-2.5-pro
```

### Codex CLI Setup

If you're using the OpenAI Codex CLI as your MCP client, add this server with:

```bash
codex mcp add opencode -- npx -y @gilby125/opencode-mcp-tool -- --model google/gemini-2.5-pro --fallback-model google/gemini-2.5-flash
```

After that, start Codex CLI as usual and you can talk to OpenCode via natural language (for example, "use opencode to explain index.html") and let Codex call the MCP tools when helpful.

### Verify Installation

Type `/mcp` inside Claude Code to verify the opencode-cli MCP is active.

### Alternative: Import from Claude Desktop

If you already have it configured in Claude Desktop:

1. Add to your Claude Desktop config:
```json
"opencode": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@gilby125/opencode-mcp-tool", "--", "--model", "google/gemini-2.5-pro"]
}
```

2. Import to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
```

## Configuration

Register the MCP server with your MCP client. **Note: The server requires a primary model to be specified.**

### For NPX Usage (Recommended)

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opencode": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@gilby125/opencode-mcp-tool", "--", "--model", "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "--fallback-model", "google/gemini-2.5-flash"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Global Installation

If you installed globally, use this configuration instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opencode": {
      "command": "opencode-mcp",
      "args": ["--model", "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "--fallback-model", "google/gemini-2.5-flash"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex CLI Configuration

To use this server with the OpenAI Codex CLI, add the following to your `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.opencode]
command = "opencode-mcp"
args = ["--model", "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "--fallback-model", "google/gemini-2.5-flash"]
startup_timeout_sec = 20
tool_timeout_sec = 300
```

After updating the Codex config, restart `codex` and test with a command such as:

```text
/opencode:ping "Hello from OpenCode MCP!"
```

**Configuration File Locations:**

- **Claude Desktop**:
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

After updating the configuration, restart your terminal session.

## Example Workflow

- **Natural language**: "use opencode to explain index.html", "understand the massive project using opencode", "ask opencode to search for latest news"
- **Claude Code**: Type `/opencode` and commands will populate in Claude Code's interface.

## Usage Examples

### With File References (using @ syntax)

- `ask opencode to analyze @src/main.js and explain what it does`
- `use opencode to summarize @. the current directory`
- `analyze @package.json and tell me about dependencies`

### General Questions (without files)

- `ask opencode to search for the latest tech news`
- `use opencode to explain div centering`
- `ask opencode about best practices for React development related to @file_im_confused_about`

### Using OpenCode's Plan Mode

The plan mode allows you to safely test code changes, run scripts, or execute potentially risky operations with structured planning.

- `use opencode plan mode to create and run a Python script that processes data`
- `ask opencode to safely test @script.py and explain what it does`
- `use opencode plan mode to install numpy and create a data visualization`
- `test this code safely: Create a script that makes HTTP requests to an API`

### Tools (for the AI)

These tools are designed to be used by the AI assistant.

- **`ask-opencode`**: Execute OpenCode with model selection and mode control. Uses plan mode by default for structured analysis.
  - **`prompt`** (required): The analysis request. Use the `@` syntax to include file or directory references (e.g., `@src/main.js explain this code`) or ask general questions (e.g., `Please use a web search to find the latest news stories`).
  - **`model`** (optional): The model to use. If not specified, uses the primary model configured at server startup.
  - **`mode`** (optional): Execution mode - 'plan' for structured analysis (default), 'build' for immediate execution, or custom mode string.
- **`brainstorm`**: Generate novel ideas with dynamic context gathering using creative frameworks (SCAMPER, Design Thinking, etc.), domain context integration, idea clustering, feasibility analysis, and iterative refinement.
  - **`prompt`** (required): Primary brainstorming challenge or question to explore.
  - **`methodology`** (optional): Brainstorming framework - 'divergent', 'convergent', 'scamper', 'design-thinking', 'lateral', or 'auto' (default).
  - **`domain`** (optional): Domain context (e.g., 'software', 'business', 'creative', 'research').
  - **`ideaCount`** (optional): Target number of ideas to generate (default: 12).
  - **`includeAnalysis`** (optional): Include feasibility and impact analysis (default: true).
- **`timeout-test`**: Test timeout prevention by running for a specified duration.
  - **`duration`** (required): Duration in milliseconds for the test.
- **`ping`**: Echo test tool that returns a message.
  - **`prompt`** (optional): Message to echo back.
- **`Help`**: Shows the OpenCode CLI help text.

### Slash Commands (for the User)

You can use these commands directly in Claude Code's interface (compatibility with other clients has not been tested).

- **/plan**: Execute OpenCode in plan mode for structured analysis and safer operations.
  - **`prompt`** (required): Analysis request (e.g., `/plan prompt:Create and run a Python script that processes CSV data` or `/plan prompt:@script.py Analyze this script safely`).
- **/build**: Execute OpenCode in immediate execution mode for direct implementation.
  - **`prompt`** (required): Implementation request for immediate code execution.
- **/help**: Displays the OpenCode CLI help information.
- **/ping**: Tests the connection to the server.
  - **`prompt`** (optional): A message to echo back.
